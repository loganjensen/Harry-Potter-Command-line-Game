# CS162-Final-Project

Harry Potter themed command-line game.

In order to make compiling my program easy, I have included a makefile for compilation. Simply type "make" to compile the program where the makefile and other source code are found. You have 50 turns to save the Hogwarts Express from disaster. Good luck!
